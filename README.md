# qr-code-generator
A simple Python Flask API server that generates QR codes from URLs provided in GET requests. The API takes a URL as a query string parameter and returns the QR code in PNG format. This project demonstrates the basic usage of the qrcode library and the creation of RESTful APIs with Flask.

This project can be useful as a starting point for a more complex QR code generation service, or as a demonstration of how to integrate QR code generation into an existing web application.
